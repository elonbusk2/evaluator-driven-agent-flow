## EDAF 4-Phase Gate System - IMPORTANT

**When the user requests to implement a feature using "エージェントフロー" (agent flow) or "EDAF", you MUST follow this exact workflow:**

### Phase 1: Design Gate
1. Launch `designer` agent via Task tool
2. Designer creates design document in `docs/designs/{feature-slug}.md`
3. Launch ALL 7 design evaluators in parallel via Task tool:
   - design-consistency-evaluator
   - design-extensibility-evaluator
   - design-goal-alignment-evaluator
   - design-maintainability-evaluator
   - design-observability-evaluator
   - design-reliability-evaluator
   - design-reusability-evaluator
4. Review evaluation results
5. If evaluators request changes, ask designer to revise
6. Repeat until all evaluators approve (≥ 7.0/10.0)

### Phase 2: Planning Gate
1. Launch `planner` agent via Task tool
2. Planner creates task plan in `docs/plans/{feature-slug}-tasks.md`
3. Launch ALL 7 planner evaluators in parallel via Task tool:
   - planner-clarity-evaluator
   - planner-deliverable-structure-evaluator
   - planner-dependency-evaluator
   - planner-goal-alignment-evaluator
   - planner-granularity-evaluator
   - planner-responsibility-alignment-evaluator
   - planner-reusability-evaluator
4. Review evaluation results
5. If evaluators request changes, ask planner to revise
6. Repeat until all evaluators approve (≥ 7.0/10.0)

### Phase 2.5: Implementation
1. Launch appropriate worker agents via Task tool based on task plan:
   - database-worker-v1-self-adapting (for database models)
   - backend-worker-v1-self-adapting (for backend logic)
   - frontend-worker-v1-self-adapting (for UI components)
   - test-worker-v1-self-adapting (for tests)
2. Workers implement code according to task plan
3. Play notification: `bash .claude/scripts/notification.sh "Implementation complete" WarblerSong`

### Phase 3: Code Review Gate
1. Launch ALL 7 code evaluators in parallel via Task tool:
   - code-quality-evaluator-v1-self-adapting
   - code-testing-evaluator-v1-self-adapting
   - code-security-evaluator-v1-self-adapting
   - code-documentation-evaluator-v1-self-adapting
   - code-maintainability-evaluator-v1-self-adapting
   - code-performance-evaluator-v1-self-adapting
   - code-implementation-alignment-evaluator-v1-self-adapting
2. Review evaluation results
3. If evaluators find issues, fix them
4. Repeat until all evaluators approve (≥ 7.0/10.0)
5. **UI/UX Verification (if frontend files were modified):**
   - **CRITICAL: This is a MANDATORY step that CANNOT be skipped**
   - **Step 1: Detect Frontend Changes**
     - Check if any frontend files were modified:
       - Components: `**/components/**/*`, `**/pages/**/*`, `**/views/**/*`
       - Styles: `**/*.css`, `**/*.scss`, `**/*.sass`, `**/*.less`
       - Scripts: `**/src/**/*.{tsx,jsx,ts,js,vue,svelte}`
     - If NO frontend files modified, skip to step 6
     - If YES frontend files modified, proceed to Step 2

   - **Step 2: Create UI Verification Todo List**
     - Use TodoWrite tool to create dynamic checklist
     - Ask user which pages/components need verification (AskUserQuestion)
     - Ask user if login is required (AskUserQuestion with options: Yes/No/Mixed)
     - If login required, collect credentials securely
     - Generate checklist based on answers (see template below)

   - **Step 3: Execute UI Verification Checklist**
     - Complete EACH todo item sequentially
     - Mark each item as completed only after successful execution
     - DO NOT skip any items in the checklist

   - **Step 4: Generate Verification Report**
     - Copy template from: `.claude/templates/ui-verification-report-template.md`
     - Fill in all sections with actual verification results
     - Save to: `docs/reports/phase3-ui-verification-{feature-name}.md`
     - Include ALL screenshots with relative paths

   - **Step 5: Run Verification Script**
     - Execute: `bash .claude/scripts/verify-ui.sh {feature-name}`
     - If script FAILS, fix issues and re-run
     - If script PASSES, proceed to step 6

   **UI Verification Checklist Template:**
   ```
   Prerequisites:
   - [ ] Create directory: docs/screenshots/{feature-name}/
   - [ ] Confirm development server running
   - [ ] Collect login info (if needed)

   Authentication (if required):
   - [ ] Navigate to login page
   - [ ] Fill credentials and login
   - [ ] Screenshot: login-success.png

   For EACH modified page:
   - [ ] Navigate to {page-url}
   - [ ] Screenshot: {page-slug}.png
   - [ ] Verify layout and design compliance
   - [ ] Test interactive elements (forms, buttons, etc.)
   - [ ] Screenshot: {page-slug}-{action}.png (for each action)
   - [ ] Check browser console for errors

   Final Steps:
   - [ ] Generate report: docs/reports/phase3-ui-verification-{feature-name}.md
   - [ ] Run script: bash .claude/scripts/verify-ui.sh {feature-name}
   - [ ] Verify script output shows ✅ PASSED
   ```

   **Only proceed to step 6 if:**
   - ✅ All todos completed
   - ✅ Verification report exists in docs/reports/
   - ✅ All screenshots saved in docs/screenshots/
   - ✅ Verification script passes

6. Play notification: `bash .claude/scripts/notification.sh "Code review passed" WarblerSong`

### Phase 4: Deployment Gate (Optional)
1. Launch ALL 5 deployment evaluators in parallel via Task tool:
   - deployment-readiness-evaluator
   - production-security-evaluator
   - observability-evaluator
   - performance-benchmark-evaluator
   - rollback-plan-evaluator
2. Review evaluation results
3. If evaluators find issues, fix them
4. Repeat until all evaluators approve (≥ 7.0/10.0)
5. Play notification: `bash .claude/scripts/notification.sh "Deployment ready" WarblerSong`

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- NEVER skip phases
- NEVER launch evaluators directly - always use Task tool with subagent_type
- ALWAYS launch all evaluators in each phase in parallel
- ALWAYS wait for ALL evaluators to approve before proceeding to next phase
- ALWAYS play notification sounds after each phase completes

## Instructions for Claude Code

When working with EDAF Workers and Evaluators, please follow these rules:

### 1. Terminal Output Language

**Respond to the user in ENGLISH for all terminal output, messages, and explanations.**

Examples:
- "✅ Database model created"
- "📋 Starting code quality evaluation"
- "❌ Error: File not found"

### 2. Documentation Language

**Generate ALL documentation in ENGLISH.**

When creating markdown files, API documentation, README files, or code comments:
- Write in English
- Use standard English technical terms
- Provide English examples

Example:
```markdown
# User Model

## Overview

This model manages user information.

## Fields

- `email`: Email address (required)
- `password`: Password (hashed)
```

---

## Notification System

EDAF includes a sound notification system to alert you when tasks complete or errors occur.

### How to Use Notifications

After completing a task or evaluation, play a notification sound:

```bash
bash .claude/scripts/notification.sh "Task completed" WarblerSong
```

**Available Sounds:**
- `WarblerSong` - Pleasant bird song (recommended for task completion)
- `CatMeow` - Cat meow (recommended for errors or attention needed)
- `Glass` - System glass sound (macOS only)

**When to Use:**
- After a Worker completes implementation: `WarblerSong`
- After an Evaluator completes evaluation: `WarblerSong`
- When an error occurs: `CatMeow`
- When user attention is needed: `CatMeow`

**Example:**
```bash
# After database-worker completes
bash .claude/scripts/notification.sh "Database models created" WarblerSong

# After evaluator finds issues
bash .claude/scripts/notification.sh "Evaluation complete - issues found" CatMeow
```

**Configuration:**
- Notification settings are in `.claude/edaf-config.yml`
- Sound files are in `.claude/sounds/`
- Notification script is at `.claude/scripts/notification.sh`
- Plays 3 times with 1.8 second intervals for comfortable notification
